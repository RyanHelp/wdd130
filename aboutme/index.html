    <h2>Ryan Weis</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Ryan Weis and I recently moved to America three years ago from Germany. It has been a crazy adventure being here but it is completely worth every second. I am hoping to study here and get to know the area while I get my degree in Computer Science and move back home once more once I have accomplished that. In my free time I really enjoy writing books and spending time just letting my mind wonder. I am really excited to be in this classs and can't wait to get to know everyone! </p>
